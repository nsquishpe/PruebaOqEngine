The demo consists of two parts: hazard and risk. The hazard and risk
calculations are defined in separate .ini files and were designed to be
run together to form a complete end-to-end demonstration of the workflow.

**Hazard**
Expected runtime: 10 seconds  
Outputs: Ground Motion Fields

**Risk**
Expected runtime: 1 minute  
Outputs: Average Asset Damages, Average Asset Losses, Realizations
