Classical PSHA Benefit Cost Ratio (BCR) Demo
--------------------------------------------

The demo consists of two parts: hazard and risk. The hazard and risk
calculations are defined in separate .ini files and were designed to be
run together to form a complete end-to-end demonstration of the workflow.

**Hazard**  
Expected runtime: 1 minute  
Outputs: Hazard Curves, Seismic Source Groups

**Risk**  
Expected runtime: 10 seconds
Outputs: Benefit Cost Ratios, Seismic Source Groups
